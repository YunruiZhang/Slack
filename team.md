<h1>WELV Iteration 2 Plan</h1>

We have split iteration 2 into three main parts. The first part is completing full system tests at the HTTP level using urllib. Each person will be writing tests for the functions that they wrote tests for in iteration 1 as they are familiar with those functions. The test function breakdown in our team is as follows:

- auth_http_tests.py - Paul
- message_http_tests.py - Yunrui
- channels_http_tests.py - Chris
- other_http_tests.py - Daniel (This includes user tests)
- new_function_tests.py - Lina 

The second part follows in a similiar matter, where each member will complete their respective functions. The function breakdown in our team is as follows:

- auth.py - Paul
- message.py - Yunrui
- channels.py and channel.py - Chris
- other.py and user.py - Daniel
- new functions - Lina
- server.py - All

Finally we will use peer reviewing by looking over one other member's code to ensure that everything is working correctly and efficiently." Which will work as follows:

- auth.py - Lina
- message.py - Paul
- channels.py and channel.py - Yunrui
- other.py and user.py - Chris
- new functions - Daniel
